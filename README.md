DM Data Products for Operations

Certain DM data products will be useful for operating the Observatory.  Some 
of these may augment or duplicate data products already generated by Summit 
systems such as the Camera diagnostic cluster; others will be generated only 
by DM, but by definition cannot be required for science operations 
(possibly in a degraded mode).  Some data products are generated automatically
in the course of processing; others can be generated on request from an 
automated Observatory system or a human operator.
